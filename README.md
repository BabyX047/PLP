PLP is a 16-week Software Engineering bootcamp, designed to help reach the goal of 1,000,000 million Devs for Africa.
I was accepted into the program and began my journey on the 19th of Feb 2024.

6 weeks into the program, we have gotten to the point of specialization. 
I have decided to drop Dart and pursue web and python concurrently.
